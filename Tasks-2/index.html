      <h2>How to Play 🕹:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Click on any two cards to flip them over and reveal the letters on
          their back sides.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the letters on the two flipped cards match, those cards will remain
          face up, indicating they have been successfully matched.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the letters do not match, the cards will flip back over to their
          face-down position after a short delay.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue flipping pairs of cards until all matching pairs have been
          found.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Rules 🚀:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Only two cards can be flipped at a time.</li>
        <li>
          If two flipped cards do not match, they will be flipped back over
          after 1 second.
        </li>
        <li>The game ends when all pairs have been successfully matched.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tips 💡:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Try to remember the positions and letters of previously flipped cards
          to find matches more efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          Start by flipping over different pairs each time to gain more
          information about the card positions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Winning the Game 🥇:</h2>
      <p>
        You win the game when you have successfully matched all 8 pairs of
        cards, and all cards are face up.
